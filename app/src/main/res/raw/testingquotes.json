  "quote": "Youth is a hoax. It's evil. People who make a big deal of their \"youth\", are just inviting trouble. They try to keep everything going on around them. For them, if there's something that has to do with their \"youth\", they jump at it without a second thought. From normal daily life, to rebelling against the view of society. If you fall in with them - lies, secrets, failure, and even crimes await you. But for them, it's just a spice of life. And if failure is also a mark of \"youth\", then isn't it ironic, that a person who failed to make any friends, is also technically leading his \"youth\"? Though I wonder if they would agree. Everything runs on their schedule. Let me be clear. The people who enjoy their \"youth\", will eventually fall apart. ",
